# CSGORankMeAPI
API for Rank Me CSGO Stat tracking plugin

# Purpose
This API is for us with a web interface to allow users to view the stats from Counter Strike Global Offensive servers running the RankMe plugin found <a href='https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1456869'>Here</a> or Kento's version found <a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=290063">Here</a>

# Restrictions

The main restriction as of now is that there is only support for mySQL and not sqlite. I will possibly start development of a seperate project for converting sqlite to mySQL so that people can go down that road if they wish. I may also work on implementing support for sqlite into the current project, stay tuned!

# Installation
